# Use Cases Template

This document provides guidelines for describing Use Cases in the context of HEIDI. 

## Template

Use cases should be described using the following criteria:

- **Use case Title**
- **Actor** - who is performing the actions in the use case
- **Submitter** - organisation or person submitting the use case
- **User Story** - what the actor wishes to do
- **Restrictions** - any standards, systems or technologies which MUST be used in terms of the use case

## Procedure
Anyone may submit a use case for consideration by submitting a Pull Request or by filing an Issue with the use case to this Github. 

You MAY formulate your use case as an amendment/extension to an already existing one, if that seems most suitable.

Once a use case is accepted, requirements MUST take the use case into consideration.
