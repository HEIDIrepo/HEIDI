# HEI Identifiers Whitepaper

## Relevance

Higher education institutions are a pivotal enitity for many different systems and applications. Institutional identifiers are thus a matter of priority.

With less than 10000 HEIs in Europe the numbers are relatively managable, but yet large enough to warrant some standardisation to allow for data exchange without manual intervention or mapping.

## Existing systems

Various approaches already exist to identify higher education institutions in Europe:

| Identifier               | Maintained by         | Used in                | Link                                                                      | Comment                                              |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| PIC                      | EU                    | European Student Card  | [EU portal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/participant-register) | expected to be discontinued |
| eIDAS identifier         | EU                    | EDCI                   | [EU page](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/trust-services-and-eid) |                                                |
| Erasmus Institution Code | EU                    | ?                      | ?                                                                         | still in use?                                        |
| SCHAC                    | GÃ©ant                 | ELMO, Emrex, ...       | [SCHAC](https://wiki.refeds.org/display/STAN/SCHAC)                       |                                                      |
| ETER ID                  | consortium, EU-funded | ETER, OrgReg, DEQAR    | [ETER](https://eter-project.com/#/home)                                   |                                                      |

At the moment, these are not articulated to each other.

## Requirements

- unique
- stable over time
- track demography & history (e.g. mergers, name changes, ...)

## Options

1. Agreement on one system
    - Could we agree on one? Which one?
    - Who maintains it?
2. One or several systems to provide mapping/link
    - Who could offer it?
    - How to propagate changes? Risk of inconsistencies?
3. Institutions to publish their identifiers
    - How to ensure critical mass?
    - How to discover institution's list?
4. Additional mapping/translation service
    - Who would run it?
    - Maybe highest overhead of all options
